# School_District_Analysis
Analysis on state test scores for a city school district utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook. 

## Overview of School District Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize Python and Jupyter Notebook to automate the task of analyzing state-testing scores across a city school district in order to determine future budget allocation. The score results are reviewed by grade, school, school type, school size, and current budget per student to determine if any of those factors impact scores.  During the analysis of data, the school board found evidence there was academic dishonesty associated to Thomas High School ninth graders.  The analysis takes this into consideration to determine the overall impacts so proper budgeting can occur.
The data utilized for the analysis can be accessed through the following links: ![schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/dschul01/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and ![students_complete.csv](https://github.com/dschul01/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv)

## Results from Thomas High School (THS) Academic Dishonesty
The analysis below shows the impact of the potential Thomas High School (THS) ninth grade academic dishonesty on the district metrics. 

### Impact to District
There are minimal impacts to the district from the THS issue due to the small count of THS ninth graders in comparison to the total district's student body count.  Images below show all district scores vs replacing THS ninth grade scores with 'Not a Number' (NaN).  
* Average Math Score decreased by 0.1%
* % Passing Math decreased by 0.2%
* % Passing Reading decreased by 0.1%
* % Overall Passing decreased by 0.3%
