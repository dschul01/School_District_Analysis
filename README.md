# School_District_Analysis
Analysis on state test scores for a city school district utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook. 

## Overview of School District Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to utilize Python and Jupyter Notebook to automate the task of analyzing state-testing scores across a city school district.  The score results are reviewed by grade, school, school type, school size, and current budget per student to determine if any of those factors impact scores.  During the analysis of data, the school board found evidence there was academic dishonesty associated to Thomas High School ninth graders.  The analysis takes this into consideration to determine the overall impacts so proper budgeting can occur.
The data utilized for the analysis can be accessed through the following links: ![schools_complete.csv].(https://github.com/dschul01/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/schools_complete.csv) and ![students_complete.csv](https://github.com/dschul01/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/students_complete.csv)
